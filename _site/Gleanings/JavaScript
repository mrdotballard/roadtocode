querySelector vs. getElementBy..
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14377590/queryselector-and-queryselectorall-vs-getelementsbyclassname-and-getelementbyid

About the differences, there is an important one in the results between querySelectorAll and getElementsByClassName: the return value is different. querySelectorAll will return a static collection, while getElementsByClassName returns a live collection. This could lead to confusion if you store the results in a variable for later use:

    A variable generated with querySelectorAll will contain the elements that fulfilled the selector at the moment the method was called.
    A variable generated with getElementsByClassName will contain the elements that fulfilled the selector when it is used (that may be different from the moment the method was called).
